# VBA_Practice
## The Purpose of the project:

The goal is to edit the code to make it more efficient and capable of handling thousands of stocks. The refactored code will loop through all the data in one pass to collect the same information as the original code. The performance of the original and refactored code will be compared to determine the effectiveness of the refactoring. 

## Process
This set of instructions provides a step-by-step guide to refactoring code in VBA to analyze stock market data for multiple tickers, allowing for faster execution of the script. 

The instructions include creating output arrays for ticker volumes, starting prices, and ending prices, initializing the ticker volumes to zero, and using for loops to loop through the rows and arrays to calculate and output the total daily volume and return for each ticker. 

The goal is to determine if the refactored code runs faster and produces the same results as the original code. Finally, the user is instructed to save the elapsed run time for the refactored code in the form of pop-up messages for both 2017 and 2018 and to save changes to the workbook
